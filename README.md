# Syntactor

An editor with two basic goals:
1. Only allow valid code to be entered (no syntax errors)
2. At least as fast at making changes as regular editors

For now, it's only a JSON editor.

## Getting started

### Installation

```bash
yarn
#or
npm install
```

### Start

```bash
yarn start
#or
npm start
```

## Roadmap

1. Copy & Paste ([#1](../../issues/1))
2. Undo/Redo ([#2](../../issues/2))
3. JavaScript Support
4. Atom/VSCode/Nuclide Plugin
