# Syntactor

An editor with two basic goals:
1. Only allow valid code to be entered (no syntax errors)
2. At least as fast at making changes as regular editors

For now, it's only a JSON editor.

## Getting started

### Installation

```bash
yarn
#or
npm install
```

### Start

```bash
yarn start
#or
npm start
```

## Roadmap

1. Embeddable (similar API to CodeMirror)
2. JavaScript Support
3. Atom/VSCode/Nuclide Plugin
